which was inspired by SunRocket VoIP Dial Linkify (http://www.muehlen.com/projects/voip/voip_dial.user.js)  
which in turn was inspired by UPS Tracking Linkify (http://plutor.org/files/upslinkify.user.js)

What's It Do?
-------------

Turn phone numbers into hyperlinks so you can click them to auto-dial using
Microsoft Lync (or other compatible dialer).

How Can I Help?
---------------

Please help me to update the REGEX for international numbers, currently this
script only matches numbers from US sources. International support is the number
one requested update!
